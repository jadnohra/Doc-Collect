# docu_collect
For a full picture of a more of less complex software library which provides its source code, it is often very useful to run [doxygen](https://github.com/doxygen/doxygen) over it, with full source code included, and contemplate the results. 

Often, this is not provided with the library. When it is provided in html form one cannot easily copy it or print it. The idea behind this repository is to collect such documentations, either in chm of pdf form. Even when they become out-of-date, such files would still be valuable.
