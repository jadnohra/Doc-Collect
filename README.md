# docu_collect
For a full picture of a more of less complex software library which provides its source code, it is often very useful to run [doxygen](https://github.com/doxygen/doxygen) over it and contemplate the results. Often, this is not provided with the library. The idea behind this repository is to collect such documentations, either in chm of pdf form.
